SimplerMoney
============

A Chrome extension that rounds-up dollar amounts that appear on a webpage.

For example, $3,999 will be re-written as $4000.00, which is what you should be thinking when you are about to get your credit card out when you see a stupid amount like $3,999 but you don't think that because WHAM, COGNITIVE FLAWS.
